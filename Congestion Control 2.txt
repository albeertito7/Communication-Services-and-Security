Additive increase/Multiplicative decrease
    - improve of the original algorithm

    - CWMAX, CongestionWindow absolute maximum value
    - cwini, cwnd initial value (usuarlly 1 MSS)
    - cwmax, cwnd maximum value (initially set to CWMAX)
    - When an ACK is received,
        
            if cwnd < cwmax {
                cwnd = cwmax
            }
            else {
                cwnd += MSS/cwnd => ADDITIVE INCREASE
                cwmax = MIN(CWMAX, cwnd)
            }
    
    - When TimeOut,

            cwnd = cwini
            cwmax = MAX(cwini,  cwmax/2) => MULTIPLICATIVE DECREASE

    - Idea: TimeOut => retransmissions => worst congestion => fast reaction
    - RTT must be estimated accurately => adaptative retransmission
        - RTT will tell when a TimeOut is produced
