Resource allocation: set of procedures that allows a network element to decide about how to assign the available resources (bandwidth and buffers size)
    - decide about the traffic that arrives

Congestion Control: set of procedures that avoid or correct congestion at the network

- What is the difference between congestion control and flow control?
    - congestion control operates at network and/or transmitter
    - flow control does the same at receiver


Network Model: IP based
    - Packet switching
    - Non-connected traffic flow => IP protocol is non-connected
    - Service model: sometimes the intermediate network should provide some information (bandwith, delay, ...) (QoS)


Service Policies

    - queue poliy: the way a router schedules its incomming traffic
        - which packets must be transmitted and what order
        - which packets must be dropped if queue overflows

    - First In Frist Out (FIFO)
        - a drop tail procedure may be adhered
        - doesn't provide any kind of congestion control and resource allocation
        - implies external congestion control and resource allocation => e.g. at TCP layer
    
    - Variations:
        - tag IP packets with a priority field (TOS) => Type Of Service
        - implement multiple queues with different priority
        - Problem: high priority queues may block lower ones transmission

    
    - Fair Queueing (FQ)
        - assuming that congestion control and resource allocation relies on TCP, the problem of having greedy processes murt be overcome
        - FQ solves the problem having multiple queues assigned to different streams, being served cyclically (Round-Robin) (RR)
        - STREAM: division of the bandwidth
        - Problem: because of diff size of the packets we can not guarantee to provide to each stream the specific bandwidth

        - Different packet sizes. How they are served?
            1. Packets arrive in sequence. Ai arribal time of the i_th packet. Si is the packet length
            2. Fi => estimated time to finish. When an arriving packet founds the server free, Fi = Ai + Si. When the server is busy, Fi = max(F', Ai) + Si
            3. Being F' the finish time of the packet being served
            4. The packet with the lower Fi is transmitted first
