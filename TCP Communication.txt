TCP Communication
    - end to end => the agents speaks TCP protocol, but not the INTERMEDIATE network (routers speak up to layer 3 IP)
    - ensure message delivering
    - ensure message ordering
    - support different message sizes
    - allow the receiver to stablish a Flow Control over the message delivery rate
        - the two agents maybe are implemented using diff technology and one its faster than the other => set an appropiate pace
    - allow multiple applications communicate through the same machine => multiplexing concept => diff communications through the same IP

Low architecture communication layers (IP, Ethernet) don't avoid the following problems:
    - packet loss
    - packet ordering
    - duplicate packet delivery
    - max packet size to be delivered
    - time limit for packet delivery => when a packet is sent, this must be considered lost usually after 2'

    - in an IP network if one packet is loss, there's no way to recover it
    - those problems can't be dealt by the lower layer protocols
    ** this problems are solved by the TCP protocol **


TCP Highlights
    - connection oriented
    - full duplex
    - reliable
    - ordered delivery
    - byte stream based. We call segment the TCP data unit
    - flow control (avoids receiver overload)
    - congestion control (avoids network overload)
    - multiplexing
