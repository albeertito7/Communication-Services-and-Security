Wireless Networks Notes

3 parts:
    - wireless technologies (standards, physical layer, mac layer, WLAN frames, etct)
    - wifi security (authentication, privacy, understand the current standard security 802.11i the most secure standard for wireless communications)
    - wifi deployments


Wireless Ethernet

- our Wifi is a wireless implementation of the Ethernet standards

- an Ethernet is a cable network at which some clients (stations) are attached
- the idea of Wireless communication is to implement some kind of multiple access but in the air, not in a wire
    in the air, it is a bit much more complicated to manage all the stuff needed

- WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) rises as an alternative to wired networks (Ethernet)
- to employ radio frequency

- and because the communications should be transmit on air
    - the transmission can not be longer be transmitted using baseband as when using Ethernet
    - so if a station sends this baseband signal to an anthena, the output radiation will drop into a small range
        because baseband signals are not suitable to be transmitted into the air because of physical reasons
    
    - Baseband signals must be MODULATED before transmitted to the air
        and depending on the carrier frequency of the modulation the anthena radiation will have particular properties

        - today wireless communications performs at two different frequencies: 2.4 and 5 GHz
    
- each stations radiates its signals to the air with a specific power, depending on the radio equipment
- this power determines which is the range


IEEE => Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering => Institution that deals with Standaritzation
                                                           => define STANDARDS related to internet communications
- at early 90s IEEE starts the 802.11 working group
- particulary for wireless communications the .11 group defines all the subsequence standards: .11b, .11ac, .11i, etc.


Multiple Access

- basic idea of communications
- to share some common media (the air, a wire, etc)
- based on the existance of multiple station that want to transmite over the same media

- so if if the aim is to get transmission without interference, raises three methods:
    - TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)
    - FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)
    - CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)

- this three methods are the only ones that can share a communication with partners
- all three are equivalent, can provide the same bandwidth/performance

TDMA
- every user will transmite its information at different times slots
- the media shared by time

FDMA
- every user uses a different frequency carriers

CDMA
- transmissions at the same time and at the same frequency
- each bit of the transmission is multiplied by a specific user CODE
- each user has its own code
- and the only requierement is that those codes should be orthogonal
    if code1 * code2 the result must be 0


WLAN Technologies

- two main transmission techniques

    Narrow Band => FDMA
        - a frequency band is assigned to each client
        - frequency assignment such that no interferences among clients

    Broad Band => CDMA
        - clients physically interfere among them
        - spread spectrum techniques recover itnerfering situation
        - so, more immunicty to external interfering sources


WLAN

- uses TDMA mechanism overall
- and uses Broad Band not to share the media but in order to immune the transmissions over external interferences
- but all users/stations using the same CODE

- so basically, WLAN uses Broad Band not to provide Multiple Access but to spread the spectrum in order to get more immunity



Wireless communications are Modulated Transmission

- so they operate at some frequency
- ther are not baseband transmissions

- the frequency depends on the standard: 2.4 or 5 GHz

- each network should operate in a particular channel



Different Configurations in a WLAN scenario

    - Ad-hoc (not really used)
        - communicate each station with its corresponding peer
        - communicate direcly to other client

** Wirelss interfaces have different modes**
** a few are: adhoc, managed, monitor, AP (Access Point) **

    - distributed networks (infraestructure mode)
        - each station communicates with others using the Access Point
        - this APs are wired to the LAN (Local Area Network)

        - the client station interfaces operates in mode: managed
        - the main station operates in mode: Access Point (may be a router)

        - each AP covers a particular cell, which it is own frequency (channel)
        - the idea is to deploy as much as AP as needed to cover all the geographical area and with the objective to avoid channel interferences
        - so if there is an area where two channels interfere, choose their frequency accurately in such a way that in the common area no interference will exist


**
* i/f monitor mode, used when we want to sniff traffic
* whenever this traffic goes to you or not
**

**
* if you want to communicate two stations without using AP, you can use adhoc mode
* also you can use one of your stations with AP mode
**


Medium Access Control (MAC)

- Which is the MAC on these types of networks?


- CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) no longer efficient for wireless lan
