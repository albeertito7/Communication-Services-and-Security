Wireless Networks Notes

3 parts:
    - wireless technologies (standards, physical layer, mac layer, WLAN frames, etct)
    - wifi security (authentication, privacy, understand the current standard security 802.11i the most secure standard for wireless communications)
    - wifi deployments


Wireless Ethernet

- our Wifi is a wireless implementation of the Ethernet standards

- an Ethernet is a cable network at which some clients (stations) are attached
- the idea of Wireless communication is to implement some kind of multiple access but in the air, not in a wire
    in the air, it is a bit much more complicated to manage all the stuff needed

- WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) rises as an alternative to wired networks (Ethernet)
- to employ radio frequency

- and because the communications should be transmit on air
    - the transmission can not be longer be transmitted using baseband as when using Ethernet
    - so if a station sends this baseband signal to an anthena, the output radiation will drop into a small range
        because baseband signals are not suitable to be transmitted into the air because of physical reasons
    
    - Baseband signals must be MODULATED before transmitted to the air
        and depending on the carrier frequency of the modulation the anthena radiation will have particular properties

        - today wireless communications performs at two different frequencies: 2.4 and 5 GHz
    
- each stations radiates its signals to the air with a specific power, depending on the radio equipment
- this power determines which is the range


IEEE => Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering => Institution that deals with Standaritzation
                                                           => define STANDARDS related to internet communications
- at early 90s IEEE starts the 802.11 working group
- particulary for wireless communications the .11 group defines all the subsequence standards: .11b, .11ac, .11i, etc.


Multiple Access

- basic idea of communications
- to share some common media (the air, a wire, etc)
- based on the existance of multiple station that want to transmite over the same media

- so if if the aim is to get transmission without interference, raises three methods:
    - TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)
    - FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)
    - CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)

- this three methods are the only ones that can share a communication with partners
- all three are equivalent, can provide the same bandwidth/performance

TDMA
- every user will transmite its information at different times slots
- the media shared by time

FDMA
- every user uses a different frequency carriers

CDMA
- transmissions at the same time and at the same frequency
- each bit of the transmission is multiplied by a specific user CODE
- each user has its own code
- and the only requierement is that those codes should be orthogonal
    if code1 * code2 the result must be 0


WLAN Technologies

- two main transmission techniques

    Narrow Band => FDMA
        - a frequency band is assigned to each client
        - frequency assignment such that no interferences among clients

    Broad Band => CDMA
        - clients physically interfere among them
        - spread spectrum techniques recover itnerfering situation
        - so, more immunicty to external interfering sources


WLAN

- uses TDMA mechanism overall
- and uses Broad Band not to share the media but in order to immune the transmissions over external interferences
- but all users/stations using the same CODE

- so basically, WLAN uses Broad Band not to provide Multiple Access but to spread the spectrum in order to get more immunity



Wireless communications are Modulated Transmission

- so they operate at some frequency
- ther are not baseband transmissions

- the frequency depends on the standard: 2.4 or 5 GHz

- each network should operate in a particular channel



Different Configurations in a WLAN scenario

    - Ad-hoc (not really used)
        - communicate each station with its corresponding peer
        - communicate direcly to other client

** Wirelss interfaces have different modes**
** a few are: adhoc, managed, monitor, AP (Access Point) **

    - distributed networks (infraestructure mode)
        - each station communicates with others using the Access Point
        - this APs are wired to the LAN (Local Area Network)

        - the client station interfaces operates in mode: managed
        - the main station operates in mode: Access Point (may be a router)

        - each AP covers a particular cell, which it is own frequency (channel)
        - the idea is to deploy as much as AP as needed to cover all the geographical area and with the objective to avoid channel interferences
        - so if there is an area where two channels interfere, choose their frequency accurately in such a way that in the common area no interference will exist


**
* i/f monitor mode, used when we want to sniff traffic
* whenever this traffic goes to you or not
**

**
* if you want to communicate two stations without using AP, you can use adhoc mode
* also you can use one of your stations with AP mode
**


Medium Access Control (MAC)

- Which is the MAC on these types of networks?

- CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) no longer efficient for wireless lan
- CSMA works fine with ethernet because the frame uses to be really larger than the lan network itself
    but this doesn't happen on wireless communication, which could be smaller

- Hidden Station problem: interferences are produced cuz of out of range respect other stations


- then, the idea is to think into something different:

MACA protocol (Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)
    - A wants to send to B => A sends a RTS (Request To Send) packet, which contains the size of the data to be sent
    - all the stations receiving RTS from A (inside A range) keep quiet until B responds
    - B sends a CTS (Clear To Send) to A, telling its availability to receive data
        CTS frame also have the data size from A
    - all the stations receiving CTS from B (inside B range) keep quiet during B transmission time
    - when a RTS is sent and no response is received, enters into a exponential binary backoff retranmission


** RTS and CTS frames can collide **
** so, if you sent and RTS and doesn't receive a CTS you wait some time and try again **



MACAW protocol (Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance for Wireless)

- efficiency improved

- sending ACK when a frame has been correctly received
- but it is no major improvement


**
* On Wireshark will see some RTS, CTS and ACK before seeing data transmissions
* RTS, CTS , ACK => repeated pattern for every wireless transmission
**


WLAN Frames

- DataFrames: end user information frames
- Controls Frames: MAC operation related frames, such as RTS, CTS, ACK, ...
- Management Frames: Management operations related to beacons, authentication, SSID, ...



WLAN frame structure (format)

    - Preamble: two fields
        - Sync: some bits of 0101... pattern, used for receiver synchronization
            during the first 80 bits there is a perfect signal (clock signal 1Mbps), used by the receiver to synchronize
            the receiver clock should be the same of the transmitter one (the same frequency rate)
        - SDF (Start Frame Delimiter): 16 bits (0000 1100 1011 1101)

    - PLCP Header (Physical Layer COnvergence Procedure)
        - information related with radio (radio information)
        - this information is related to what kind of modulation, transmission speeds, bands, channels, etc. used
    - MAC Frame
        Layer 2 frame


MAC Frame

          2            2          6           6           6           2         6            0 - 2312         4        Bytes

    Frame Control | Duration | Address 1 | Address 2 | Address 3 | Sequence | Address 4 |       Body        | CRC

    - Frame Control
        - protocol: set to 00
        - type frame: there are two bits which determines the type of frame
            - 00: Management
            - 01: Control
            - 10: Data
        - subtype
        - To DS (Distribution System): set to 1 for frames going to AP
        - From DS: set to 1 for frames coming from AP
        - Fragmentation: indicates fragmented data
        - Retransmission: 1 if retransmitted
        - PM (Power Management) tells that station is goint to enter in power saving mode
        - PMD: set 1 if AP has pending data for a PM mode station
        - WEP: indicates if the data is protected or not (enciphered data)
        - Order

            2       2       4        1        1        1        1       1     1     1     1     Bytes

        Protcol | Type | Subtype | To DS | From DS | Frag. | Retrans. | PM | PMD | WEP | Order


    - Duration => it has two different meanings
        1. How will last the current transmission in microseconds
            indicates the time that channel is expected to be busy during the current transmission
        2. not important

    - Addresses => really important
        - MAC frames always will have up to 4 adresses

        - BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) => AP MAC wired address
            identifies a Wirless Lan

        - Addr1 => destination in the air
        - Addr2 => origin in the air
        - Addr3 => end-source or end-destination
        - Addr4 =>
    
        - all controls and management frames has ToDS & FromDS as 00, but also Ad-Hoc networks
            taking into account that in Ad-hoc networks as there is no AP the Addr3 BSSID is randomly generated

        - when both bits sets to 1 => Wireless bridges
            you can communicate two AP via a radio (Wireless) communications, and not only with a wired one

    - Sequence: for fragmented frames indicates their sequence order
    - the most important part is the Body => where the data is (IP packet)
    - CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Code) => to protect all the body information, IS A ERROR DETECTOR



- a set of BSSID perform a SSID for short

Example:

    - eduroam is an ESSID (Extended SSI) composed by several BSSID (BSSID1, BSSID2 ... etc.)
    - why different BSSID? because eduroam network has different IPs but all of them belongs to the same extended SSID which is eduroam

    - ESSID => 32 ASCII characters included in management frames, such as the beacon frames
        - this is how networks are identified, by using beacon frames which are a special kind of management frames
            that anounces the network
