Wireless Networks Notes

3 parts:
    - wireless technologies (standards, physical layer, mac layer, WLAN frames, etct)
    - wifi security (authentication, privacy, understand the current standard security 802.11i the most secure standard for wireless communications)
    - wifi deployments


Wireless Ethernet

- our Wifi is a wireless implementation of the Ethernet standards

- an Ethernet is a cable network at which some clients (stations) are attached
- the idea of Wireless communication is to implement some kind of multiple access but in the air, not in a wire
    in the air, it is a bit much more complicated to manage all the stuff needed

- WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) rises as an alternative to wired networks (Ethernet)
- to employ radio frequency

- and because the communications should be transmit on air
    - the transmission can not be longer be transmitted using baseband as when using Ethernet
    - so if a station sends this baseband signal to an anthena, the output radiation will drop into a small range
        because baseband signals are not suitable to be transmitted into the air because of physical reasons
    
    - Baseband signals must be MODULATED before transmitted to the air
        and depending on the carrier frequency of the modulation the anthena radiation will have particular properties

        - today wireless communications performs at two different frequencies: 2.4 and 5 GHz
    
- each stations radiates its signals to the air with a specific power, depending on the radio equipment
- this power determines which is the range


IEEE => Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering => Institution that deals with Standaritzation
                                                           => define STANDARDS related to internet communications
- at early 90s IEEE starts the 802.11 working group
- particulary for wireless communications the .11 group defines all the subsequence standards: .11b, .11ac, .11i, etc.


Multiple Access

- basic idea of communications
- to share some common media (the air, a wire, etc)
- based on the existance of multiple station that want to transmite over the same media

- so if if the aim is to get transmission without interference, raises three methods:
    - TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)
    - FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)
    - CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)

- this three methods are the only ones that can share a communication with partners

TDMA
- every user will transmite its information at different times slots
- the media shared by time

FDMA
- every user uses a different frequency carriers

CDMA
- transmissions at the same time and at the same frequency
- each bit of the transmission is multiplied by a specific user CODE
- each user has its own code
- and the only requierement is that those codes should be orthogonal
    if code1 * code2 the result must be 0
