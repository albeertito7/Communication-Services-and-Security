Wireless Networks Notes

3 parts:
    - wireless technologies (standards, physical layer, mac layer, WLAN frames, etct)
    - wifi security (authentication, privacy, understand the current standard security 802.11i the most secure standard for wireless communications)
    - wifi deployments


Wireless Ethernet

- our Wifi is a wireless implementation of the Ethernet standards

- an Ethernet is a cable network at which some clients (stations) are attached
- the idea of Wireless communication is to implement some kind of multiple access but in the air, not in a wire
    in the air, it is a bit much more complicated to manage all the stuff needed

- WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) rises as an alternative to wired networks (Ethernet)
- to employ radio frequency

- and because the communications should be transmit on air
    - the transmission can not be longer be transmitted using baseband as when using Ethernet
    - so if a station sends this baseband signal to an anthena, the output radiation will drop into a small range
        because baseband signals are not suitable to be transmitted into the air because of physical reasons
    
    - Baseband signals must be MODULATED before transmitted to the air
        and depending on the carrier frequency of the modulation the anthena radiation will have particular properties
