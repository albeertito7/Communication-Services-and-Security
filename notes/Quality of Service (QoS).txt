QoS - Quality of service

- ability of the network to give/improve some service for a specific network traffic
- What u expect from QoS? - adjust some features for this specific traffic
    - dedicated badwith
    - improving packet losses
    - avoiding and managing congestion
    - shaping traffic: match traffic specification to some parameters applied to the traffic
    - setting priorities across the network: how this priorities can be set? and how this priorities travel thorugh the network from one point to another

QoS Architecture - three essential components
    - QoS in a single network: queueing, shceduling and shaping
    - QoS across networks: signaling
    - QoS policy and management


Queueing
    - a router has only one hardware queue, but
    - soft queues only formed when incoming traffic is faster than outcoming rates
    - By default (if not QoS defined), slow output i/fs (few Mbps) use Weighted Fair Queueing. Otherwise: FIFO applied
    - Queue length may be configured
    - When queues are full, traffic is dropped

Scheduling
    - the way the soft queues are served:
        - WFQ (flow based, class based) => how to determine the flows to asisgn the rate/bandwith?
        - Custom queueing: assigns a given bandwidth
        - Priority queueing: Assigns priority. Higher priorities are served first

Shaping
    - average rate and maximum burst size are enforced on outgoing traffic
    - token bucket mechanisms

Signaling:
    - Field TOS (Type of Service) of IPv4 header marked to indicate priority
    - 3 MSB (Most Significative Bits) determine IP precedence. 8 priority levels
    - 6 MSB determine DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point, DiffServ). New Standard

QoS sercice models
    - models: how the service capabilities are described in a network
    - 3 models:
        - Best effort
        - Integrated Services
        - Differentiated services
    
    - Best effort:
        - No QoS applied
        - FIFO Queueing

    - Integrated Services:
        - using some specific protocols such as RSVP (Reservation Protocol)
        - will ask for bandwith and delay requierements
        - if possible: WFQ or WRED (Weighted RED) adjusting its configuration to the network deal

    - Differentiated services
        - not explicitly requested a particulary service
        - using IP Precedence or DCSP signaling, to put this bits into the network
