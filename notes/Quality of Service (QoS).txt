QoS - Quality of service

- ability of the network to give/improve some service for a specific network traffic
- What u expect from QoS? - adjust some features for this specific traffic
    - dedicated badwith
    - improving packet losses
    - avoiding and managing congestion
    - shaping traffic: match traffic specification to some parameters applied to the traffic
    - setting priorities across the network: how this priorities can be set? and how this priorities travel thorugh the network from one point to another

QoS Architecture - three essential components
    - QoS in a single network: queueing, shceduling and shaping
    - QoS across networks: signaling
    - QoS policy and management


Queueing
    - a router has only one hardware queue, but
    - soft queues only formed when incoming traffic is faster than outcoming rates
    - By default (if not QoS defined), slow output i/fs (few Mbps) use Weighted Fair Queueing. Otherwise: FIFO applied
    - Queue length may be configured
    - When queues are full, traffic is dropped

Scheduling
    - the way the soft queues are served:
        - WFQ (flow based, class based) => how to determine the flows to asisgn the rate/bandwith?
        - Custom queueing: assigns a given bandwidth
        - Priority queueing: Assigns priority. Higher priorities are served first

Shaping
    - average rate and maximum burst size are enforced on outgoing traffic
    - token bucket mechanisms
